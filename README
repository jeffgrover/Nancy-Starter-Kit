There’s a popular lightweight Ruby web app framework called “Sinatra” many of you are probably familiar with.
You can do a lot with it by writing very little code… just set up your URL route to execute RESTful commands & serve pages.
 
Recently, I found that there’s a C# framework inspired by it called “Nancy”.  (Nancy Sinatra… get it?).
 
This is a simple project to get you started, if you’re interested in playing with… um… her.
 
(The “StaticContentBootstrapper” just allows this self-hosting nancy app to serve up static content.
Nancy can also be served up by IIS/ASP.NET… and you wouldn’t need this)
 
This example doesn’t do anything very exciting…  but if you run the project and connect to
http://localhost:8888/
OR     http://localhost:8888/?username=MyName
 
You’ll see it illustrates the very basics of writing a controller to render model objects and parameters in a view.
 
If you’re interested in going further with… um… Nancy, check out:
